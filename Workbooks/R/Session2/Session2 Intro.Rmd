## Session Goals

- Step through key open source packages and data structures for working with geospatial hydrology data in R and Python
- This is a live coding session - our hope is that everyone can code along with us
- We will focus primarily on R but introduce Python equivalents for most operations

## What will we cover this hour?

- Getting spatial data into R / Python
- Typical data structures and libraries for spatial data in R / Python
- Manipulating vector data in R / Python
- Manipulating raster data in R / Python
- Basic geoprocessing operations with vector and raster data in R / Python

## Caveats

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
- This is A LOT to cover in an hour - we will just scratch the surface
- We've provided a number of links on the workshop [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mhweber/AWRA2022GeoWorkshop) to previous workshops and key resources for working with geospatial hydrology data in R and Python
- Please ask questions as we go!

## Logistics

- I'll be stepping through code examples in an [R Notebook](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-10.html) and running code in RMarkdown files in RStudio
- I'll switch over to a Jupyter Notebook during this section to demonstrate analogous code steps in Python to what we run in R
- You can run the Jupyter Notebooks locally if you set up a local environment 
or you can run in Binder
