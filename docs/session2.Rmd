##  Data Manipulation

- The manipulation of `data.frames` almost always comes back to SQL queries

--

- R and Python abstract the SQL logic and provide function-ized methods for executing these core tasks.

--

- `dplyr` is the primary "tidyverse" package for doing this in R, while `pandas` is the "go to" in python.

--

- `dplyr` describes is functionality as a 'grammar of data manipulation' which is useful for discussion in that the functions we call, are things we "do" to the `data.frame`

---


## Verbs

We will cover two "pure" verbs:

- `select()`: picks variables based on their names.
- `filter()`: picks rows/observations based on their values.

And three "manipulation" verbs
- `mutate()`: adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
- `summarise()`: reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
- `arrange()`: changes the ordering of the rows.


These all combine naturally with `group_by()` which allows you to perform any operation "by group".

---

## The %>% (pipe) operator
 
The pipe operator (`%>%`) will change your data workflow in R.

This syntax leads to code that is much easier to write and to read.

The RStudio keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+M (Windows), Cmd+Shift+M (Mac).

The pipe passes the object on the left hand side of the pipe into the first argument of the right hand function

To be %>% compatible, the `data.frame` is ALWAYS the fist argument to dplyr verbs

---

# Data

For demonstration we will get some streamflow data from the USGS. The details of this function will come latter in the course so focus on the data

```{r}
flows = readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '14187200',
                   parameterCd = "00060") %>% 
  renameNWISColumns() 


glimpse(flows)
```

---

## Use `filter()` to subset on a condition

- `filter()` takes logical (binary) expressions and returns the _rows_ in which all conditions are TRUE.

- `filter()` does NOT impact columns


--

- Lets find all rows in `flows` data that in have Flow code A:

```{r}
filter(flows, Flow_cd == "A") %>% 
  glimpse()
```

---

## Use `filter()` to subset data on multiple conditions

- Lets find all observations in `flows` where the Date is after `2000-01-01`, _and_ the Flow Code is A:

--

```{r}
filter(flows, Flow_cd == "A", Date > as.Date("2010-01-01")) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

---

## Use `select()` to subset by variables or columns.

- Use `select()` to subset the variables or columns you want by name (think of the `$` syntax).

--

```{r}
select(flows, Date, Flow) %>%
  glimpse()
```

---

## Use `select()` to subset and rename

`select()` can also be used to rename existing columns

```{r}
select(flows, Date, flow_cfs = Flow) %>%
  glimpse()
```

---

# Use mutate() to add new variables

--

- `mutate()` defines and inserts new variables into a existing `data.frame`

--

- `mutate()` builds new variables sequentially so you can reference earlier ones when defining later ones 

--

- In the `flows` dataset we have a Date value that will allow us extract a Year and month

--

```{r}
flows %>%
  select(Date, Flow) %>% 
  filter(Date > as.Date('2010-01-01')) %>%
  mutate(Year  = format(Date, "%Y"),
         Month = format(Date, "%m")) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

---

# Arrange 

- orders the rows of a `data.frame` rows by the values of selected columns.


```{r}
tmp  = flows %>%
  select(Date, Flow) %>% 
  filter(Date > as.Date('2020-01-01')) %>%
  mutate(Year  = format(Date, "%Y"),
         Month = format(Date, "%m")) 
  
head(arrange(tmp, as.numeric(Year)))

head(arrange(tmp, -as.numeric(Year)))
```


---

## `summarize()`

Have you ever had questions like "_what is the mean streamflow?_", but only have daily data?

- `summarize()` takes a dataset with n observations, computes requested values, and returns a dataset with 1 observation.


```{r}
flows %>% 
 select(Date, Flow) %>% 
 mutate(Year  = format(Date, "%Y")) %>%
 summarize(meanQ = mean(Flow),
           maxQ = max(Flow))
  
```

---

## `group_by()`

Have you ever had questions like "_what is the mean annual streamflow?_", but only have daily data?
- `group_by()` adds extra structure to your dataset by grouping information (think of atomic diminsion)

- `mutate()` and `summarize()` honor groupings.

--

Combined with the verbs like `select`, `filter`, and `arrange` these new tools allow you to solve an extremely diverse set of problems with relative ease.

```{r}
tt = flows %>% 
 select(Date, Flow) %>% 
 mutate(Year  = format(Date, "%Y")) %>%
 group_by(Year)

paint::paint(tt)
  
```

---

```{r}
tt2 = tt %>%
 summarize(meanQ = mean(Flow),
           maxQ = max(Flow))

glimpse(tt2)
```

---

## Dont forget!

- `group_by` adds _structure_ to your `data.frame` that impacts how data is manipulated, when done with your groupings dont forget to `ungroup()`

```{r}
flows %>% 
 select(Date, Flow) %>% 
 mutate(Year  = format(Date, "%Y")) %>%
 group_by(Year) %>%
 summarize(meanQ = mean(Flow),
           maxQ = max(Flow)) %>%
 ungroup()
```

# Relational Data

- There will come a time when you need data from different sources. 

--

- When this happens we must **join** -- or merge -- multiple `data.frames`

--

- To merge data, we have to find a point of _commonality_

--

- The attribute of _commonality_ is the _relation_ (e.g. realational data!)

---

# Relational Data

To work with relational data we need "verbs" that work with _pairs_ (**2**) of tables.

--

 - **Mutating joins**: add *new* variables to one table from matching observations in another.

--

 - **Filtering joins**:  filter observations from one table if they match an observation in the other table.

--

The most common place to find relational data is in a relational database management system (or RDBMS)


---

# Keys

- The _variables_ used to connect a pair tables are called **keys**.

--

- A key is a variable (or set of variables) that uniquely identifies an observation or "unit". 



---

# Keys

There are two types of keys:

--

- **Primary keys**: *uniquely* identify observations in its own table. 

--

- **Foreign keys**: *uniquely* identify observations in another table. 

--

- A _primary_ key and a corresponding _foreign_ key form a _relation._ 

--

- Relations are typically one-to-many but can be one-to-one

# Summary

- To a computer all data is bytes
- Software like R/Python know how to interpret bytes as values
- Multiple values can be stored with structure
- Like type values can be stored in atomic vectors and dislike types can be stored as lists

- Both R and python make extensive use of data.frames which are lists with enforced equal length elements (columns)

- SQL-ish and other data manipulations can be executed on data.frames for custom analysis, data creation, and question answering
