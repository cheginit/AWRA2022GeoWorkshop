# Data

Computers convert bytes --> hex --> value

- Humans read values
- Software reads Hex bytes
- Hardware reads Binary bytes

---

## Example

---

## What's the difference between 3 and '3'

--

**To us**: _meaning_

--

**To software**: _hows its handled_

--

**To a computer**: _nothing_

--

Thus, there is a need for a computer "guessable" / human definable data `types`.

---
class: center, middle, inverse
# Data Types (main 6)
---

### 1. Double/float (e.g. `2`, `2.15`)

- Values with decimals
- Generally the default computational data type
- There are three special values unique to doubles: `Inf`, `-Inf`, and `NaN` (not a number). 


---

### 2. integer (e.g. `2L`)

- Values _without_ decimals 
- To create an integer you must follow the a number with an uppercase L.
- Take less memory then doubles but this is rarely an issue on modern computers and "normal" size data

```{r}
object.size(1:1000)
object.size(as.numeric(1:1000))
```

---

### 3. character (e.g. `"x"`, `"Welcome!"`)

- Stores text ranging in size from a single letter to a novel.
- surrounded by `"` ("here") or `'` ('there'). 
- Special characters are escaped with `\`; see `?Quotes` for full details.

---

### 4. logical (e.g. `TRUE`, `FALSE`)

- Logical values store boolean values (`TRUE` and `FALSE`). 
- Useful for checking conditions and controlling the flow of a program.
- Or, for checking binary conditions (like on,off;  open/closed; >100)
- Logicals can be written in full (TRUE or FALSE), or abbreviated (T or F).
- Logicals are effectively 0 (F) and (1)

```{r}
as.numeric(TRUE)
as.integer(FALSE)
```

---

### 5. raw (e.g. holds `bytes`)
### 6. complex (e.g. `1+4i`) 

---

`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("type")`

```{r type, include = F}
# Numeric
typeof(1.9)

# Integer
typeof(1L)

# Boolean
typeof(TRUE)

# Character
typeof("Welcome")
```


---
class: center, middle, inverse
# Data Structure
### Storing more then one value requires **structure**!
---

## Vectors

- **Vectors** come in two types: _atomic_ and _list_

--

-  _atomic_ vectors elements must have the same **type**

--

- _lists_ elements can have different **types** 

--

- `NULL` serves as a generic zero length vector. 

--

- This diagram - taken from [here](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html) illustrates the basic relationships:


<img src="img/04-vec-list-01.png">


---

### Atomic Vectors

A vector containing one **type** of data is called an "atom"
  - Can created using the `c()` (combine) function in R and with brackets `[` in Python numpy
  - The length can be checked with `length()` (R) or `len()` (python)

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="60%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04-vec-list-02.png")
```

---

`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("atom")`

```{r atom, include = F}
# Numeric
dbl_vec = c(1.9, 2, 3.5)
typeof(dbl_vec)
length(dbl_vec)

lg_vec = c(TRUE, FALSE, F, T)
typeof(lg_vec)
length(lg_vec)

```

---

# Missing Values!

- Missing values still need a place holder
- Missing values are denoted with `NA` (short for not applicable). 
- Missing values are 'infectious': most computations involving a missing value will return another missing value.

```{r}
x = c(2,4)
y = c(2, NA)

x + y
```

---

## Cohersion

- As seen above, type is a property of the vector

- When you try and combine different types they will be coerced in a fixed order: 

  - character → double → integer → logical

- Coercion often happens automatically.

- Failed coercion generates a warning and a missing value

---
`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("atoms")`

```{r atoms, include = FALSE}
c("a", 1)

c("a", TRUE)

c(4.5, 1L)

c("1", 18, "GIS")

as.numeric(c("1", 18, "GIS"))

as.logical(c("1", 18, "GIS"))
```

---

# Subsetting Atomics

Atomics can be subset using the position(s) (explicit or logical) of each value

```{r}
# Atomic numeric vector
(x = c(3.4, 7, 18, 9.6))

# Third Value
x[3]

# Third and Fourth value
x[c(3,4)]

# Drop the third value
x[-3]

# Keep the 1 and 2 value, but drop 3 and 4
x[c(T,T,F,F)]
```

---

## Diminsions

- Atomics do **not** include a number of important structures like matrices (2D) or arrays (3D), factors, or date-times. 

- These structures are built on top of atomic vectors by adding **attributes**.

- For example, adding a `dim` attribute to a vector allows it to behave like a 2D matrix or a XD array.

---

### Matrix

- A matrix is 2D atom (row, column)
 - Same data types
 - Same column length


- For spatial data, this corresponds to the structure of gridded/raster data. 

```{r matrix}
# Use matrix
(mat = matrix(1:9, nrow = 3))
```

---

# Subsetting Matrices

Now that a structure (row, column) has been assigned,
Subsetting requires a row, column (i,j) syntax

--

```{r}
(x = matrix(1:9, nrow = 3))

x[3,]
x[,3]
x[3,3]
```

---

### Arrays

- An array is a 3D atom [row, column, slice]


- For spatial data, this is corresponds to the structure of gridded/raster data with a time diminsion 


`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("arrays")`

```{r arrays, include = F}
(array(c(1:12), dim = c(3,2,2)))
```

---


# Subsetting Arrays

- Now that a structure (row, column, slice) has been assigned,

- Subsetting requires a row, column (i,j,z) syntax

.pull-left[
```{r, subarr}
(x = array(1:12, dim = c(2,2,3))) 
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
x[1,,]
x[,1,]
x[,,1]
```


---

## Lists

Lists allow each list element to be any type/strucutre.

```{r}
(my_list <- list(
  matrix(1:4, nrow = 2), 
  "GIS is great!", 
  c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
  c(2.3, 5.9)
))

typeof(my_list)
```

---

# Subsetting Lists

- With fleaxabilty of list objects comes new subsetting operartors.

- The `[[`  allows an element of list to be accessed:

```{r}
my_list[[1]]

my_list[[1]][1,2]
```

---

### Data Frames

A `data.frame` is a `structure` built on top of **lists**

--

- However, the length of each vector (list or atomic) **must** be the same. 

--

- This gives data frames their rectangular structure and explains why they share the properties of both matrices and lists

---

`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("smalldf", widths = c(60,40,0), title = "# A small data.frame")`

```{r smalldf, include = F}
(df1 <- data.frame(name = c("George", "Stan", "Carly"), 
                  age  = c(75,15,31),
                  retired = c(T,F,F)))
                  
typeof(df1)
```

---

## Subsetting data.frames

data.frames can be subset like a matrix:

```{r}
df1[1,2]
```

--

data.frames can be subset like a list:

```{r}
df1[[2]]
```

--

And, with a new operation* `$` that allows access by column name:

```{r}
df1$name
```

---

# Data Manipulation
---

The manipulation of data.frames almost always comes back to SQL queries

R and Python abstract the SQL logic and provide function-ized methods for executing these core tasks.

`dplyr` is the principle package for doing this in R, while pandas is the "go to" in python.

dplyr describes is functionality as a 'grammar of data manipulation` which is useful for discussion in that the functions we call, are things we "do" to the data.frame.

---

## Verbs

We will cover two "pure" verbs:

- `select()`: picks variables based on their names.
- `filter()`: picks rows/observations based on their values.

And three "manipulation" verbs
- `mutate()`: adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
- `summarise()`: reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
- `arrange()`: changes the ordering of the rows.


These all combine naturally with `group_by()` which allows you to perform any operation “by group”.

--- 

## The %>% (pipe) operator
 
The pipe operator (`%>%`) will change your data workflow in R.

This syntax leads to code that is much easier to write and to read.

The RStudio keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+M (Windows), Cmd+Shift+M (Mac).

The pipe passes the object on the left hand side of the pipe into the first argument of the right hand function

To be %>% compatible, the `data.frame` is ALWAYS the fist argument to dplyr verbs

---

# Data

For demonstration we will get some streamflow data from the USGS. The details of this function will come latter in the course so focus on the data

```{r}
flows = readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '14187200',
                   parameterCd = "00060") %>% 
  renameNWISColumns() 


glimpse(flows)
```

---

## Use `filter()` to subset on a condition

- `filter()` takes logical (binary) expressions and returns the _rows_ in which all conditions are TRUE.

- `filter()` does NOT impact columns


--

- Lets find all rows in `flows` data that in have Flow code A:

```{r}
filter(flows, Flow_cd == "A") %>% 
  glimpse()
```

---

## Use `filter()` to subset data on multiple conditions

- Lets find all observations in `flows` where the Date is after `2000-01-01`, _and_ the Flow Code is A:

--

```{r}
filter(flows, Flow_cd == "A", Date > as.Date("2010-01-01")) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

---

## Use `select()` to subset by variables or columns.

- Use `select()` to subset the variables or columns you want by name (think of the `$` syntax).

--

```{r}
select(flows, Date, Flow) %>%
  glimpse()
```

---

## Use `select()` to subset and rename

`select()` can also be used to rename existing columns

```{r}
select(flows, Date, flow_cfs = Flow) %>%
  glimpse()
```

---

# Use mutate() to add new variables

--

- `mutate()` defines and inserts new variables into a existing `data.frame`

--

- `mutate()` builds new variables sequentially so you can reference earlier ones when defining later ones 

--

- In the `flows` dataset we have a Date value that will allow us extract a Year and month

--

```{r}
flows %>%
  select(Date, Flow) %>% 
  filter(Date > as.Date('2010-01-01')) %>%
  mutate(Year  = format(Date, "%Y"),
         Month = format(Date, "%m")) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

---

# Arrange 

- orders the rows of a `data.frame` rows by the values of selected columns.


```{r}
tmp  = flows %>%
  select(Date, Flow) %>% 
  filter(Date > as.Date('2020-01-01')) %>%
  mutate(Year  = format(Date, "%Y"),
         Month = format(Date, "%m")) 
  
head(arrange(tmp, as.numeric(Year)))

head(arrange(tmp, -as.numeric(Year)))
```


---

## `summarize()`

Have you ever had questions like "_what is the mean streamflow?_", but only have daily data?

- `summarize()` takes a dataset with n observations, computes requested values, and returns a dataset with 1 observation.



```{r}
flows %>% 
 select(Date, Flow) %>% 
 mutate(Year  = format(Date, "%Y")) %>%
 summarize(meanQ = mean(Flow),
           maxQ = max(Flow))
  
```

---

## `group_by()`

Have you ever had questions like "_what is the mean annual streamflow?_", but only have daily data?
- `group_by()` adds extra structure to your dataset by grouping information (think of atomic diminsion)

- `mutate()` and `summarize()` honor groupings.

--

Combined with the verbs like `select`, `filter`, and `arrange` these new tools allow you to solve an extremely diverse set of problems with relative ease.

```{r}
tt = flows %>% 
 select(Date, Flow) %>% 
 mutate(Year  = format(Date, "%Y")) %>%
 group_by(Year)

paint::paint(tt)
  
```

---

```{r}
tt2 = tt %>%
 summarize(meanQ = mean(Flow),
           maxQ = max(Flow))

glimpse(tt2)
```

---

## Dont forget!

- `group_by` adds _structure_ to your `data.frame` that impacts how data is manipulated, when done with your groupings dont forget to `ungroup()`

```{r}
flows %>% 
 select(Date, Flow) %>% 
 mutate(Year  = format(Date, "%Y")) %>%
 group_by(Year) %>%
 summarize(meanQ = mean(Flow),
           maxQ = max(Flow)) %>%
 ungroup()
```

# When One Table is not enough
---


# Relational Data

- There will come a time when you need data from different sources. 

--

- When this happens we must **join** -- or merge -- multiple `data.frames`

--

- To merge data, we have to find a point of _commonality_

--

- The attribute of _commonality_ is the _relation_ (e.g. realational data!)

---

# Relational Data

To work with relational data we need "verbs" that work with _pairs_ (**2**) of tables.

--

 - **Mutating joins**: add *new* variables to one table from matching observations in another.

--

 - **Filtering joins**:  filter observations from one table if they match an observation in the other table.

--

The most common place to find relational data is in a relational database management system (or RDBMS)


---

# Keys

- The _variables_ used to connect a pair tables are called **keys**.

--

- A key is a variable (or set of variables) that uniquely identifies an observation or "unit". 



---

# Keys

There are two types of keys:

--

- **Primary keys**: *uniquely* identify observations in its own table. 

--

- **Foreign keys**: *uniquely* identify observations in another table. 

--

- A _primary_ key and a corresponding _foreign_ key form a _relation._ 

--

- Relations are typically one-to-many but can be one-to-one

# Summary

- To a computer all data is bytes
- Software like R/Python know how to interpret bytes as values
- Multiple values can be stored with structure
- Like type values can be stored in atomic vectors and dislike types can be stored as lists

- Both R and python make extensive use of data.frames which are lists with enforced equal length elements (columns)

- SQL-ish and other data manipulations can be executed on data.frames for custom analysis, data creation, and question answering
